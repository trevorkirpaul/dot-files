# Vim Settings

Whiles I mainly use VS Code, I still have settings for vim since I use it whenever working with config files or any quick work.

You'll find my `.vimrc` settings in this repo along with plug in settings for [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), the plug-in manager I use for vim.

Installing `vim-plug`:

```
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

## Plug-Ins

The only plugins I currently use are `lightline` and a color theme. I eventually want to start using vim for web development but I've invested a lot of time into VS Code.
